# AOSLO-photoreceptor-detection
This repository contains matlab software pertaining to automated photoreceptor segmentation in adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) images. The software was developed as part of our Biomedical Optics Express submission, titled "Unsupervised Identification of Cone Photoreceptors in Non-Confocal Adaptive Optics Scanning Light Ophthalmoscope Images".
