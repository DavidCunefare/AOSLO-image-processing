# AOSLO-photoreceptor-detection
This repository contains matlab software pertaining to automated photoreceptor segmentation in adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) images. The software was developed as part of our Biomedical Optics Express submission, titled "Unsupervised Identification of Cone Photoreceptors in Non-Confocal Adaptive Optics Scanning Light Ophthalmoscope Images". 

The software given on this site is provided "as is" with the aim of being used in comparison studies or as a tool for rapid annotation of photoreceptors in AOSLO split-detection images.



The software package contains the following functions/scripts:
