# AOSLO-photoreceptor-detection
This repository contains matlab software pertaining to automated photoreceptor segmentation in adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) images. The software was developed as part of our Biomedical Optics Express submission, titled "Unsupervised Identification of Cone Photoreceptors in Non-Confocal Adaptive Optics Scanning Light Ophthalmoscope Images". 

The software will be uploaded at this website following positive evaluation of the paper.

The software package contains the following functions/scripts:
